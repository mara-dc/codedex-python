### What is Codédex Python course?
It's a beginner course on Python offered by Codédex. See course [here](https://www.codedex.io/python)!

### What's in this repository?
These are python files of the exercises I did during the course.

Each file is named **##-xxx.py** where **##** is the *exercise number* and **xxx** is the *exercise name*. If you visit Codédex, you can easily identify which exercises these files correspond to.

So far, I have done the following modules in the course:
| Module  | Exercises |
| --- | --- |
| Hello World  | 01 to 05  |
| Variables  | 06 to 10  |
| Control Flow  | 11 to 16  |
| Loops  | 17 to 21  |

### Is that all?
Nope. Lessons are ongoing so I'll be putting more exercises here as I finish them. There's also an Intermediate Course for Python so we'll see!
